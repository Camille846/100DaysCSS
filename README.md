# 100 DAYS CSS CHALLENGE 
> status: Developing ⚠️

For 100 consecutive days, I've been solving a CSS code challenge as a creative learning process for myself. This repository contains several coding challenges using HTML5, CSS3, Sass and Javascript. 

# How to start
All you need to get started with the challenge is access <a href="https://100dayscss.com">the original website</a> responsible for the creation of this challenge. The homepage shows every day a different challenge which you can complete. This repository is only destinated to publish my solutions for the code challenge.
